## Color Scheme

The BookView color palette creates a clean, balanced, and user-friendly design, focusing on visual clarity and minimalism.

**Neutral Base Colors**

- Light Gray, Neutral Gray, Off White: Clean background for a spacious, uncluttered look.

**Accent Colors**

 - Bright Blue (#546CFF): Interactive elements like buttons and links.

 - Deep Purple (#1D1141): Headers, navigation bars, and important content.

 - Muted Gray (#888888): Secondary information.

**Contrasting Dark Color**

**Design Approach**

- Minimalist Palette: Limited colors for a clean design, focusing on content.

- Accessibility: High contrast for readability.

## Typography

For the visual identity of this project, I have selected two fonts to maintain a consistent and professional look:

- **The Bold Font**: Used for the **logo**. It gives a strong and distinctive personality.
  - Font URL: [The Bold Font](https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/the-bold-font)

- **Lato**: Used for the **body text** to ensure readability and clarity across various devices and screen sizes.
  - Font URL: [Lato](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:ital,wght@0,100;0,300;0,400;0,700;0,900;1,100;1,300;1,400;1,700;1,900&display=swap)

These fonts help create a modern, cohesive style for the branding and readability of the project.

## Wireframes

For designing the wireframes of this project, I chose **Figma** due to its powerful, visual, and collaborative design capabilities. Figma allows for:

- **Visual-first approach**: Its intuitive, drag-and-drop interface makes it easier to create wireframes with precision and clarity.
- **Cloud-based**: Access the wireframes from anywhere, without worrying about software installation.

You can view the project wireframes in my [Figma project](#). *(Replace `#` with the actual Figma link when available.)*
